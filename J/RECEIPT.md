# VK issue #589 receipt (cursor-ubuntu vkfill-589)

**Start sha:** `7bc66068db57e6afa646eec0ddbcf911b4f5f9ed`  
**Tip sha:** `0fd6dc78`

## Problem

Gate B structure on `migrate/trek-source` failed `logo not centred with name` for Events list rows (Apple Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Blue Note, …): `missing visible name line (fail closed)`. Capture records `first_text` only from a `span`/`strong` leaf inside `[data-ts-list-row-name]`; default `Oe()` rows used plain `ua` text in that span (no leaf), so `first_text` was null while the logo chip was measured.

## Fix

Wrap the default non-flight/car/hotel title in `<strong>` when building `Zn` in `src/vacation/shared-trip-oe-list-row-patch.mjs`; rebake `public/assets/index-BKun7ofk.js`. Assert in `scripts/test_itinerary_fresh_daybyday_bundle.mjs`.

# VK issue #597 / PR #600 CI fix (round 1)

**GBrain handoff:** `bot-admin/lanes/vk-pr-handoff/pr-600` — **page not found** (checked via MCP `get_page`, 2026-10-21).

**CI failure:** `scripts/test_gate_b_product_row_fields.mjs` expected 63 ccab enrichment keys; #597 added `Midtown sample hotel` (+ duplicate Romer ASCII key).

**Fix:** Drop duplicate `Romer Hell's Kitchen` enrichment entry; resolve ccab keys through `resolveNycCcabKey` before lookup; expect **64** documented places in the gate-b product row test.

**Check:** `node scripts/test_gate_b_product_row_fields.mjs` → pass (2026-10-21 local).

# VK PR #600 round 2 (cursor-ubuntu vkfill-600)

**Start sha:** `e2ea7d18d0692883a95212fb0ebcab66a7279d30`  
**Tip sha:** `b8a2da1a`

**Problem:** Round 1 resolved ccab lookup in `buildGateBSearchPlaceForRow` but `assertGateBRowProvenance` still compared raw list-tab `ccabKey` (ASCII apostrophe) to materialized `externalId` (curly apostrophe via `resolveNycCcabKey`), so `node scripts/regenerate_pr336_search_trip_fixture.mjs` failed on row 625.

**Fix:** Resolve ccab keys in `assertGateBRowProvenance` the same way as build; skip fuzzy title/ccab mismatch when `resolveNycCcabKey(row.name)` already matches. Regenerated snapshot sets row 625 `externalId` to `Romer Hell's Kitchen` (curly).
